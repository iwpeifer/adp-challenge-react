This app utilizes a provided JSON object that contains four Star Wars API (swapi.co) endpoints. I was tasked with retrieving information about each film the provided characters have been in, making sure that info was displayed only after *all* data was loaded. The endpoint given for Obi-Wan Kenobi was purposefully broken so that I would have to handle errors.

Made with React.
